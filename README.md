## My process

I started with the HTML and then moved to CSS, where I started to style it from top to bottom.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

I learned to use the relative position. Very easy project for someone who recently stepped in the world of development! 


### Continued development

I still want to practice more how to use flexbox.
